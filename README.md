<h3>My2Dgame is my first Unity <i>platformer</i> game! :D</h3>

<strong>Features:</strong>
- Player movement (Arrow keys on the keayboard) and physics
- Collisions (both hard and triggered)
- Sprite flip for the character when moving to the sides
- Prefabs for enemy/hazards and interactables (coins, key, lock, ..)
- Includes 2 levels with distinct themes (~ summer/winter related)
- Applied force when jumping on trampoline (Level 1)
- Map exploration: 1 heart per level that increases the score a lot (requires a key)
- Main Menu
- Pause Menu (by pressing 'Esc')
- Coin and key/heart animations
- Save Game State (for the Continue option on Pause Menu)
- Max Score shown in Main Menu after the game is played at least once

<strong>Rules:</strong>
- When the player dies they only lose the points acquired in the particular level they were on
- The lock to the heart for each level only opens with the key present in that same level
- The goal is to survive the levels by reaching the red flag at the end of each level



<strong>>> To be implemented:</strong>
- Add background music
- Character movement sound
- Animation sounds
- Death sound
- Fix platform movement (for Level 2)
- Fix UI scaling and colors (adjust screen size)
