<h3>My2Dgame is my first Unity <i>platformer</i> game! :D</h3>

<strong>Features:</strong>
- Player movement (Arrow keys on the keayboard) and physics
- Collisions (both hard and triggered)
- Prefabs for enemy/hazards and interactables (coins, key, lock, ..)
- Includes 2 levels with distinct themes (~ summer/winter related)
- Applied force when jumping on trampoline (Level 1)
- Has 1 heart per level that increases the score a lot (requires a key)
- Main Menu
- Pause Menu (by pressing 'Esc')
- Coin and key/heart animations

<strong>Rules:</strong>
- When the player dies they only lose the points acquired in that particular level
- The lock to the heart for each level only opens with the key present in that same level
- The goal is to survive the levels by reaching the red flag at the end of each level



<strong>>> To be implemented:</strong>
- Save Game State (for the Continue option of Pause Menu)
- Max Score in Main Menu (at the bottom)
- Background music
- Animation sounds
- Character movement sound
- Death sound
